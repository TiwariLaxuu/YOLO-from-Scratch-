# YOLO-from-Scratch-

YOLOV2/ YOLOV9000 paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf 

All the config file which is needed for object detection and other image classification purpose. https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/tree/master/cfg 

Darknet publish a various config which is easy to create a model for every algorithm like Yolov1, YoloV2, YoloV3, .... YoloV7 .

Darknet is used in YOLO for better accuracy and fast prediction which can be used real world scenerios. 
VGG-16 requires 30.69 billion floating point operations for a single pass over a single image at 224 × 224 resolution, Google net requires 8.52 billion operations for a forward pass, while Darknet-19 only requires 5.58 billion operations.

When we analyze YOL0’s performance on ImageNet we see it learns new species of animals well but struggles with learning categories like clothing and equipment.
