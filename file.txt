Batch Normalization. Batch normalization leads to significant improvements in convergence while eliminating the
need for other forms of regularization [7]. By adding batch
normalization on all of the convolutional layers in YOLO
we get more than 2% improvement in mAP. Batch normalization also helps regularize the model. With batch normalization we can remove dropout from the model without
overfitting.
